# Recogonize Mini Robot Cards with TensorFLow Lite Model Maker and Android Studio ML Model Binding

## Introduction
This project is a first try to use a Tensor Flow Lite (TFL) trained model to recognize cards with Android Studio 4.1 and Ml Model Binding.

The model was previously trained in Google Colab:

Used DataAugmentation library to get a lot of images to train on the neuronal network:
